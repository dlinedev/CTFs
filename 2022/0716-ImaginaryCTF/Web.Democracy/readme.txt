Democracy (130pts) - 68 solves
by puzzler7
Description
I'm tired of all these skill-based CTF challenges. Y'know what we need more of here? Politics! Simply convince (or strongarm) your fellow competitors to vote for you. The top 1% of players who have the most votes (or top 50, whichever is less) will recieve the flag. This voting will occur 5 times per hour. Keep in mind that no matter how many accounts you make, you can only vote once per IP. Good luck, and happy campaigning!
